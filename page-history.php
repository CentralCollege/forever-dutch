        <p><strong>P.H. Kuyper Gymnasium’s aging infrastructure must be replaced.</strong> And a building designed to serve 200 athletes in 1969, now must handle more than 700, turning hallways into athletic training treatment areas. Facilities are in use from 5 a.m.-11 p.m.</p>
        <p>It’s often been said that the athletics department is a college’s front porch. Student-athletes comprise a significant part of Central’s enrollment and many of the college’s competitors are making major athletics facilities upgrades.</p>
        <p><strong>This is the time not just for a renovation, but a transformation that will accentuate Central’s position as an intercollegiate leader, as well as a model for whole-person development.</strong></p>
